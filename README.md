      disableDashboard: false,

  ],
})
```

## Features

### Dashboard Component

The plugin adds a dashboard component to the HubSpot Forms collection that displays:

- Total number of forms
- Total form views
- Total form submissions
- Average conversion rate
- A sortable table of all forms with comprehensive metrics including:
  - Form views and submissions
  - Conversion rates and click-through rates
  - Form interactions and submission rates
  - Copy-to-clipboard functionality for form IDs

### HubSpot Forms Collection

The plugin creates a `hubspot-forms` collection in your Payload CMS with the following fields:

- `formId`: The HubSpot form GUID (required, unique)
- `name`: The form name (automatically synced from HubSpot, read-only)

The collection includes automatic hooks that:

- Sync form names from HubSpot when formId is updated
- Update existing forms on server startup (doesn't create new ones automatically)

### API Endpoints

The plugin adds the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/hubspot/forms`: Returns a list of all HubSpot forms with comprehensive statistics
  - Add `?refresh=true` to force a refresh of the 1-hour cache
- `GET /api/my-plugin-endpoint`: Custom endpoint (example implementation)

### Analytics Data

Each form includes the following analytics:

- `views`: Total form views
- `submissions`: Total form submissions
- `conversionRate`: Submissions per form view (when <= 1)
- `clickThroughRate`: Click-through rate per form view
- `interactions`: Total form interactions
- `submissionRate`: Submissions per click-through
- `nonContactSubmissions`: Non-contact form submissions
